Integrate Your Java Service

Download the Datadog Java tracer agent by running the following command in your terminal:

wget -O dd-java-agent.jar 'https://dtdg.co/latest-java-tracer'


This will download the dd-java-agent.jar file to your current directory.

Start your Java application with the Datadog Java agent attached by executing:

java -javaagent:"dd-java-agent.jar" -jar <application-jar-file>


Replace <application-jar-file> with the path to your Java application's JAR file.

Verify Service Visibility
After starting your Java application with the agent, your service should appear in the Datadog dashboard under the list of monitored services.

Explore Metrics and Monitoring
You can now explore various metrics, create monitors, and configure dashboards to gain insights into your service's performance and health.
